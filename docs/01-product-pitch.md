# Product Pitch: Playable Portfolio Town

## Core Idea
Instead of scrolling a static portfolio, visitors play through a compact pixel town.
Each building, NPC, and sign reveals part of your story:
- professional profile (LinkedIn/CV)
- code credibility (GitHub/projects)
- founder identity (company HQ)
- social and experimental channels (YouTube/Twitter/coming soon)

## Why This Format Works
- Immediate memorability and strong personal brand.
- Natural storytelling via exploration.
- Modular content updates without redesigning entire pages.
- Gamified engagement with easter eggs and rewards.

## Experience Flow
1. Visitor lands on page and sees retro intro popup.
2. Popup explains controls and objective.
3. Player spawns in town center and explores points of interest.
4. Interacting with NPCs/buildings opens pixel dialog windows.
5. External links require a confirmation dialog before redirect.

## Target Outcome
- Portfolio that is both fun and credible.
- Clear signal of product thinking, frontend craft, and engineering quality.
- Easy to grow over time (new projects, socials, campaigns, launches).
