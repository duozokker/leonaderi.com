# Easter Eggs Backlog

## Design Principle
Easter eggs should reward curiosity without blocking core portfolio discovery.

## V1 Candidate Easter Eggs
- Hidden sign that unlocks a secret dialogue tree.
- Day/night mode toggle in a hidden alley.
- Quest NPC: "Find the 3 best projects".
- Construction house that slowly gets repaired as you add new content.
- Mini achievement list for first-time visitors.

## V2 Candidate Easter Eggs
- Retro arcade machine mini-game in company HQ.
- Secret basement with founder timeline.
- Konami code opens a debug/credits room.
- Seasonal decoration swaps (winter, launch-week, etc.).

## Implementation Notes
- Feature-flag all easter eggs.
- Keep text and triggers in content glossary to avoid hardcoding.
- Ensure mobile users can trigger eggs too.
