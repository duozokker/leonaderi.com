# What Makes a Great Portfolio Site

## Outcome-Focused Principles
- Fast first impression: show identity and value proposition immediately.
- Scannable information hierarchy: users scan quickly, so headings, labels, and structure matter.
- Proof over claims: link to real work, repos, outcomes, and company results.
- Frictionless contact: visitors should always know the next action.

## Quality Pillars For This Project

### 1) Clarity
- Clear intro popup with controls and purpose.
- Distinct districts/houses mapped to content categories.
- Consistent interaction pattern across all buildings.

### 2) Trust
- Company HQ with concrete capabilities and selected case outcomes.
- GitHub house with live repositories.
- LinkedIn house as primary CV/professional profile entry point.

### 3) Performance
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals:
  - LCP <= 2.5s
  - INP <= 200ms
  - CLS <= 0.1
- Keep assets compressed and avoid oversized sprite sheets.

### 4) Accessibility
- Keyboard support beyond movement (all modals/actions).
- Touch target sizes and mobile controls.
- Focus visibility for interactive UI.

### 5) Evolvability
- New channels (YouTube/Twitter) added by data entries, not scene rewrites.
- Status-driven visuals (`live`, `wip`, `coming_soon`, `ruins`) for progressive rollout.
