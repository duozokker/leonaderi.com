Original prompt: verbessere den weiter! der ist immer noch buggy und viele sachen kann man nicht benutzen! mache das so lange bis man das wirklich gut nutzen kann und es keine fehler gibt! höre nicht auf und gehe jedes kleinste detail durch. stoppe nur wenn du wirklich nix mehr findest. bevor du dir denkst dass du stoppen willst geh nochmal durch, finde fehler oder sachen die UI/UX technisch noch nicht optimal sind und verbessere sie! mache das als loop dauerhaft für stunden bis das tool perfekt ist

## Session Log
- Initialized progress tracking for worldbuilder stability loop.
- Next: run Playwright client against worldbuilder app, inspect screenshots/state/errors, and iterate fixes.

## TODO
- Reproduce current bugs with scripted interactions and capture baseline artifacts.
- Fix highest-impact UX blockers in canvas selection/resize/pan and inspector sync.
- Improve save/load reliability and user feedback for parse/validation errors.
- Add guardrails for bad numeric input and invalid transforms.
- Re-test with Playwright until no obvious regressions remain.
- Baseline Playwright run completed; screenshots were black canvas-only captures and no render_game_to_text output exists yet.
- Next fixes: add deterministic text-state hook, strengthen canvas rendering observability, and improve UI interactions.
- Confirmed real worldbuilder instance at http://localhost:5188 (earlier runs hit wrong app port).
- Starting UI bug pass: selection/inspector sync, canvas transforms, tabs, and import/save error handling.
- Implemented stability pass in apps/worldbuilder:
  - Added local draft/session autosave to localStorage and reset-local-draft control.
  - Added robust JSON import/apply/save error handling with status toasts.
  - Added duplicate/delete actions (buttons + keyboard shortcuts).
  - Added canvas UX controls: snap grid, labels toggle, Space+drag pan, cursor-centered wheel zoom, reset view.
  - Added trigger resize transform support and disabled entity drag while panning.
  - Added inspector enhancements: trigger type/enabled/interaction ID + NPC interaction ID edits.
  - Added render_game_to_text and advanceTime hooks for automated test loop.
  - Added worldbuilder favicon to remove 404 console error.
- Playwright loop rerun on worldbuilder URL (http://localhost:5188):
  - screenshots generated in output/worldbuilder-loop/after-fixes
  - state JSON generated (state-0..2)
  - no errors-*.json emitted
- Validation:
  - npm run lint ✅
  - npm run build -w @leonaderi/worldbuilder ✅
  - npm run build (root) ✅

## Remaining Ideas
- Add marquee/multi-select and true drag-resize handles for side-specific constraints.
- Add dedicated trigger-to-interaction editor table (create/select actions inline).
- Add minimap + fit-to-selection for large maps.
- Add undo/redo stack persisted in session.
- Final verification pass done after setting strict worldbuilder dev port to 5188.
- Playwright artifacts: output/worldbuilder-loop/final-pass (shots + state; no errors files).

  - Added camera UX: Fit Map button, Arrow-key panning, middle-mouse grab pan, clamped camera bounds.
  - Added minimap overlay with viewport rectangle.
  - Added richer render_game_to_text payload (history and top layers).
- Playwright run: output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-2 (shots + state, no errors file).
- Loop 3 completed:
  - Added frameSelection (F) and fitMap (Shift+F / toolbar).
  - Added per-layer visibility toggles (objects/colliders/triggers/npcs/minimap).
  - Added per-layer lock toggles to prevent accidental drag edits.
  - Added camera grab-pan with middle mouse hold + move.
  - Added keyboard camera panning (arrows, Shift for faster panning).
  - Updated state telemetry to include layer visibility/lock.
- Playwright run: output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-3 (shots + state, no errors file).
- Loop 4 completed:

  - Added background mode switch: Abstract / Rendered / Blend with blend opacity slider.
  - Added trigger-action inspector editing for interaction actions (dialogue/link/toast/flag/teleport/modal).
  - Verified rendered mode visually in browser snapshot (manual-rendered-view.png).
- Playwright run: output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-4 (shots + state, no errors file).

## Research Notes (editor UX references)
- Tiled editor emphasizes layer visibility/lock and map-level editing workflows.
- Unity scene workflow emphasizes framing selection and camera navigation speed.
- Godot 2D editor emphasizes intuitive viewport pan/zoom and tool-mode shortcuts.
- Loop 5 completed:
  - Added entity search filter for Objects/Colliders/Triggers/NPCs/POIs list.
  - Added object helper actions: "Auto Collider from Object" and "Create Door Trigger".
  - Added trigger->interaction action editor to configure dialogue/link/toast/flag/teleport/modal flows directly.
- Loop 6 completed:
  - Added live cursor world/tile coordinates in toolbar.
  - Added optional crosshair lines on canvas for precise alignment.
- Playwright runs: output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-5 and loop-6 (shots + state, no errors files).
- Loop 7 completed:
  - Added camera bookmarks (slots 1-4): click to load, Shift+1..4 to save, keys 1..4 to load.
  - Added bookmark persistence via localStorage.
  - Added toolbar bookmark indicators (B1..B4 with marker when set).
- Playwright run: output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-7 (shots + state, no errors file).
- Loop 8 completed:
  - Added multi-selection quality-of-life controls: Select All Objects, Clear Selection, Esc clear, Cmd/Ctrl+A select all.
  - Added marquee/pan conflict fix: no accidental marquee while pan mode/space pan is active.
  - Added depth workflow improvements:
    - Depth Guides toggle + per-selected-object depth line in canvas.
    - Object layer presets: Backdrop, Foot Layer, Roof/Behind (Pokemon-style behind-house behavior).
  - Added linked object helpers:
    - Linked collider + trigger overlays for selected object.
    - Quick collider tuning buttons (top down/up, narrower/wider).
  - Added nudge shortcut for selected objects via Alt+Arrow (Shift for larger nudge).
  - Added canvas context-menu suppression for cleaner middle/drag workflows.
- Validation:
  - npm run lint ✅
  - npm run build -w @leonaderi/worldbuilder ✅
  - Playwright runs:
    - output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-8 (sanity run)
    - output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-9 (post-change pan/zoom run)
    - output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-10 (selection click targeting check)
- Notes:
  - Playwright action client currently captures pan/zoom reliably, but click-selection assertions remain flaky with coordinate-only bursts.
  - Browser live snapshot confirms new toolbar controls and inspector shortcuts are present.
- Loop 9 completed:
  - Added explicit canvas tool system:
    - Select (V)
    - Move (M)
    - Resize (R)
  - Drag behavior now follows tool mode (move-only dragging; resize-only transformer handles).
  - Added minimap navigation: click or drag directly inside minimap to reposition camera.
  - Improved cursor modes to reflect active tool/pan state.
  - Added session persistence for canvas tool in localStorage.
  - Extended debug state payload with `canvasTool`.
- Validation:
  - npm run lint ✅
  - npm run build -w @leonaderi/worldbuilder ✅
  - Playwright run: output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-11 (no errors file).
  - Browser a11y snapshot confirms new controls and shortcuts text.
- Loop 10 completed:
  - Added player depth preview system for layering decisions:
    - toggle + Y slider in canvas toolbar
    - world-wide preview line
    - object tinting in preview mode (green behind player / red in front of player)
  - Added global action `Normalize Depth by Y` for fast depth cleanup.
  - Added selected-object preview hint in inspector describing current front/behind state.
  - Extended telemetry state with `depthPreviewY`.
- Validation:
  - npm run lint ✅
  - npm run build -w @leonaderi/worldbuilder ✅
  - Playwright run: output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-12 (no errors file).
- Loop 11 completed:
  - Switched canvas entity selection handlers from `onClick` to `onMouseDown` for snappier and more reliable direct selection.
  - Re-ran lint/build and Playwright (`output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-13`).
- Note:
  - Scripted click-selection via the current generic Playwright action client is still not reflected in `render_game_to_text` state snapshots, while pan/zoom assertions continue to work.
- Loop 12 completed:
  - Added a dedicated command legend panel in inspector with grouped controls (camera/tools/edit/history/selection/depth).
  - Keeps full command reference always visible while editing.
- Validation:
  - npm run lint ✅
  - npm run build -w @leonaderi/worldbuilder ✅
  - Playwright run: output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-14 (no errors file generated).
- Runtime stability pass:
  - Overworld scene now unsubscribes all global event-bus handlers on scene shutdown/destroy to prevent duplicate handlers after restarts.
  - Building name tags now follow object-local depth (`spriteDepth + 1`) instead of fixed top-most depth, reducing visual overlap artifacts.
- Portfolio modal UX/accessibility pass:
  - Entry and Confirm modals now expose `role=dialog` + `aria-modal`.
  - Backdrop click closes modal.
  - Keyboard focus now lands on modal action buttons when opened.
  - Escape handling in app shell closes confirm -> entry -> intro in order.
- Worldbuilder UX/control pass:
  - Save/Open/Export flows converted to stable callbacks.
  - New keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl+S save, Cmd/Ctrl+O open, G cycles view mode.
  - Legend and overlay hints updated to include new shortcuts.
- Validation hardening:
  - Extracted world validation into `apps/worldbuilder/src/lib/validation.ts` with broader checks:
    - duplicates, bounds checks, missing object refs, missing trigger interaction links,
      dialogue graph integrity + unreachable nodes.
  - Added test coverage in `tests/worldbuilderValidation.test.ts`.
- Playwright + manual verification:
  - Worldbuilder Playwright: `output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-15`.
  - Portfolio Playwright: `output/portfolio-loop/loop-1`, `output/portfolio-loop/loop-2-headed` (canvas capture issue remains black in this client).
  - Manual browser verification screenshots:
    - `output/portfolio-loop/manual-intro.png`
    - `output/portfolio-loop/manual-world.png`
    - `output/worldbuilder-loop/manual-loop-current.png`
- Online references checked for editor/runtime decisions:
  - Phaser depth sorting docs
  - Tiled editor docs
  - React Flow docs and map editor repos (RPG Paper Maker, Tiled)
- Runtime observability pass:
  - Added `window.render_game_to_text` in `OverworldScene` with scene/player/camera/admin state.
  - Added lightweight `window.advanceTime` hook for automation compatibility.
  - Debug hooks are now cleaned up on scene teardown.
- Additional verification:
  - Playwright (portfolio) rerun: `output/portfolio-loop/loop-3` now emits runtime state JSON files.
  - Playwright (worldbuilder) rerun: `output/worldbuilder-loop/loop-16`.
  - Manual checks via browser automation:
    - Intro open/close via Hilfe and Escape confirmed.
    - Worldbuilder shortcut `G` cycles view mode (snapshot confirms Rendered state).
